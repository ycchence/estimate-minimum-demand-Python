There are data about the power consumption and the estimated power generated from generator. 
If there is a battery taht can sotre power from the generator, how much power it still needs can be determined.
This assignment can estimate how much it is (minimum peak net demand) by Python.
The inputs includes battery specification(Maximum energy, Minimum energy, Maximum charging/discharge power, efficienc), power consumption,
and the estimated power generated. The time scales among these inputs are different, and this program is able to handle them. 
The output is minimum peak net demand (float number).
